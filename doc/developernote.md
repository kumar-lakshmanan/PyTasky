* INPUTS / OUTPUTS:  
	- Believe no need of this property in node module. Will default all with 1 input and 1 output.  
	- In tag will mention, if no need of input (for starter kind node with o/p only like variable).  
	- Same will mention in tag, if no need of output (for displayer kind node with i/p only).
	- TAG: oponly , iponly can be used.
	- TAG: shareop can be used if port output can be shared to mulitple next node.
